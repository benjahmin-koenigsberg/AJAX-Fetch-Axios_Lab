### ABout this App

This app is a graded lab for Per Scholas and Tek Systems React Developer Bootcamp.
I was tasked to use the provided Cat API to render images to the UI using JavaScript's fetch() and Axios to make API call and parse response data

#### Diffuculties

Code sandbox was troubling, so I moved to VS Code. I needed to change the type of script to 'module' for the code to work. I had difficulty with the built in Carousel funtion to dusplay the images to the UI. Unfortunaelty I ommited this feature and just use a Bootsrap Card element to display the first 3 images of cats that return per breed
